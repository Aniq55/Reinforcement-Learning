\section{Full information, partial information}
\hspace{-6mm}\textbf{1):} It is a problem with full information since $R_A$ is known by $A$. A problem with partial information would be %TODO


\section{EWF and EXP3 versus an oblivious adversary}
\underline{Question 1:} We choose arbitrarily as a sequence for $B$ : $(2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1\ldots)$ 
\\[3mm]We take $\eta = \sqrt{\frac{N \mathrm{log} N}{n(e-1)}}$ (formula from the class, here $N = 2$) and $\eta = 0.04$. For EXP3 we also take $\beta = \eta$.
\\We get the following regret curves :

\section{EXP3 versus EXP3 : Nash Equilibrium}
\underline{Question 2 :}

\caption{Convergence of the mean reward for player A}
\end{figure}

Even if the horizon may be not enough large, we see on Figure 2 that the probabilities seem to converge towards the Nash equilibrium $(p_a^*, p_b^*)$. Furthermore, we see more easily on the graph that the empirical mean for player A converges towards the value of the game, which is around 0,4.

\section{Stochastic bandit or adversarial bandit ?}

The original problem is the following :
\begin{verbatim}
Arm1=armBernoulli(0.2);
Arm2=armBernoulli(0.4);
Arm3=armBernoulli(0.5);

MAB={Arm1,Arm2,Arm3};
\end{verbatim}

We obtain these regret curves :

	\centering
	\noindent\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Q3-regrets-originalpb.png}
	\caption{Regret curves for Thompson Sampling and Exp3 strategies on original problem}
\end{figure}

We see that Thompson Sampling does much better than Exp3 strategy.
\\
We computed it for another problem, with only two arms with really closed means :
\begin{verbatim}
Arm4=armBernoulli(0.39);
Arm5=armBernoulli(0.4);
\end{verbatim}

And here is what we obtained :

	\centering
	\noindent\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Q3-regrets-mypb.png}
	\caption{Regret curves for Thompson Sampling and Exp3 strategies on another problem}
\end{figure}

Here, at horizon 500, Exp3 has done a little better than Thompson Sampling.
